# About Wep DLL

With the 1990-1991 Windows Entertainment Pack, aboutwep.dll was shipped. The code is very simple it just handles opening an about window for each of the games. Thought it would be a good exercise to try decompile it, which was successful, it compiles and behaves exactly like the original dll. It is not byte matching as that would be a bit overkill in my opinion.
